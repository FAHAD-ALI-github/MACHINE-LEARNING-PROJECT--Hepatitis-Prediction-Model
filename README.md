# 🧠 Hepatitis Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of survival in hepatitis patients using a Machine Learning model trained on real medical data. It is built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Scikit-learn.

## 📁 Files in this Repository
- `hepatitis.csv` - Dataset containing medical records of hepatitis patients.
- `hepatitis_prediction_project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `02_model_hapitits.pkl` - Trained ML model saved using pickle.

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pickle (for model serialization)

## ✅ What this Project Covers
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy score
- Model export for future use

## 📊 Dataset Info
The dataset contains several features like:
- Age
- Sex
- Steroid
- Liver size
- Bilirubin level
- And other medical indicators

The target is to predict whether the patient **lives (1)** or **dies (2)**.

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: ~85% (can vary depending on preprocessing)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook hepatitis_prediction_project.ipynb
   ```

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI
- Build a small frontend interface
